This is a Coding Assignment based out of React JS on server side.

The App is live on the following url: https://xt-space-assignment.herokuapp.com/

It uses starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) in order to achieve the server side rendering.

I have made mainly two UI React Components here i.e. Button and Cards which is handling our filters functionality and Display cards on the screen.

I have implemented React Hooks in order to get the API data and used media queries for suggested designs.

For UI Design for different devices like Mobile, Tablet and Desktop, I have segregated the screen in 12 different columns depending upon their screen width.

In order to run the app.

For local dev, run "npm run dev" command from your terminal
For building production build, run "npm run build" command from your terminal
